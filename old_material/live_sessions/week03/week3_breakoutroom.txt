Week 3: Naïve Bayes classification algorithm

You will work in groups of 3-4 people to solve the exercise below. Each of you can work in their own computer (make sure to collaborate!) or you can designate one person that will code for the team while sharing the screen for everyone to see.

## Exercise 1 ##
#############

Step 1: Choose one of the classification datasets available in the scikit-learn library (please don’t choose the wine dataset):
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html

Step 2: Run a Bernoulli Naïve Bayes classification algorithm using:
-	the sklearn package
-	a user defined function
In both cases, report the classification accuracy.
	

Hints: 
[1] How should the features look like for a Bernoulli classifier?

[2] The NB_Bernoulli_classifier.ipynb notebook is a good example to follow.
